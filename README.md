# ErrorHandling Smart Contract

## Overview

The `ErrorHandling` smart contract demonstrates the use of different error handling mechanisms in Solidity: `require`, `revert`, and `assert`. These mechanisms help in validating inputs and ensuring the contract's state remains consistent.

## Contract Description

### State Variables

- **coinbalance (uint)**: This variable keeps track of the total coin balance.
- **quotient (uint)**: This variable stores the result of a division operation.

### Functions

#### RequireCheck

```solidity
function RequireCheck(uint score, uint coins) public payable {
    coinbalance += coins;
    require(score >= 100, "Score is less than 100. Transaction not possible");
}
```

This function adds the provided `coins` to the `coinbalance`. It then checks if the `score` is at least 100 using the `require` statement. If the `score` is less than 100, the transaction is reverted with the message "Score is less than 100. Transaction not possible".

#### RevertCheck

```solidity
error ThrowError(string);
function RevertCheck(uint score, uint coins) public payable {
    coinbalance += coins;
    if (score < 100)
        revert ThrowError("Score is less than 100. Transaction not possible");
}
```

This function also adds the provided `coins` to the `coinbalance`. It then checks if the `score` is at least 100. If the `score` is less than 100, the transaction is reverted using a custom error (`ThrowError`), providing a message "Score is less than 100. Transaction not possible".

#### AssertCheck

```solidity
function AssertCheck(uint a, uint b) public {
    assert(b != 0);
    quotient = a / b;
}
```

This function performs a division of `a` by `b` and stores the result in `quotient`. Before the division, it uses the `assert` statement to ensure that `b` is not zero. If `b` is zero, the transaction is reverted, indicating a serious error in the code logic.

## Usage

1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the `ErrorHandling` contract to the Ethereum blockchain.

2. **RequireCheck**: Call the `RequireCheck` function with appropriate `score` and `coins` values. Ensure the `score` is at least 100 to avoid transaction failure.

3. **RevertCheck**: Call the `RevertCheck` function with appropriate `score` and `coins` values. Ensure the `score` is at least 100 to avoid transaction failure.

4. **AssertCheck**: Call the `AssertCheck` function with values `a` and `b`. Ensure `b` is not zero to avoid transaction failure.
